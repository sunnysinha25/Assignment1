# Assignment 1

~ 1)	Convert Hexadecimal to binary 24F.
24F is converted to Binary as follows:
2 4 F
= 0010 0100 1111
= 001001001111
Therefore, (24F)16 = (001001001111)2


~ 2)	Convert any one Octal to Binary.
Let us take one Octal 7635 as an example. 7635 is converted to Binary as follows:
7 6 3 5
= 111 110 011 101
= 111110011101
Therefore, (7635)8 = (111110011101)2

e.	Delivery location is set for the customer
f.	Payment can be cash, card or UPI
g.	They may dine-in or takeaway or have delivery on their address




~ 4)	Create a new Repository -add 2 files file1.txt and file2.txt commit 2 files,modify file2.txt and commit. 
Creating new Repository “repo”:![mkdir](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80207796/213917272-1d82dfcf-82c8-4429-870c-944523915b17.png)
 
Initializing the repository:
![init](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80207796/213917350-2e02cdd3-2878-4691-b2d2-f8f76322f7a7.png)

Adding 2 files “file1.txt” and “file2.txt” and commiting them respectively:
![addfiles1and2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80207796/213917360-e578f4f4-f16c-424d-8940-d80ef08deb17.png)

Modifying “file2.txt” and commiting it:
 ![modify file2 txt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80207796/213917370-7487316b-9afb-4d48-b648-ca7057cd0767.png)




5)	Create logic function to compare 2 sets of numbers and show which is greater. e.g.: 100>50
ALGORITHM NAME: 
Comparing 2 sets of numbers and showing which is greater

INPUT VARIABLE(S): num1, num2
OUTPUT VARIALBE(S): [none]

LOGIC FUNCTION: 
isGreater(num1, num2)
{    
    if num1  > num2
        display true     
    else 
        display false
