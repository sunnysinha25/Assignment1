# Assignment 1

~ 1)	Convert Hexadecimal to binary 24F.
24F is converted to Binary as follows:
2 4 F
= 0010 0100 1111
= 001001001111
Therefore, (24F)16 = (001001001111)2


~ 2)	Convert any one Octal to Binary.
Let us take one Octal 7635 as an example. 7635 is converted to Binary as follows:
7 6 3 5
= 111 110 011 101
= 111110011101
Therefore, (7635)8 = (111110011101)2

Repository “repo”:
 

Initializing the repository:
 

Adding 2 files “file1.txt” and “file2.txt” and commiting them respectively:
 
Modifying “file2.txt” and commiting it:
 



5)	Create logic function to compare 2 sets of numbers and show which is greater. e.g.: 100>50
ALGORITHM NAME: 
Comparing 2 sets of numbers and showing which is greater

INPUT VARIABLE(S): num1, num2
OUTPUT VARIALBE(S): [none]

LOGIC FUNCTION: 
isGreater(num1, num2)
{    
    if num1  > num2
        display true     
    else 
        display false
